1) Improve efficiency on searching for moves
  -- First tile we should check for info on is a tile that changed since we last checked it
  -- Once we have a piece of information, we should look for a tile that contains that info, than any tile that intersects it, and only then continue forward

2) Better starting moves

3) Better guessing

4) Run the code without vue - I wanna see some statistics baby
